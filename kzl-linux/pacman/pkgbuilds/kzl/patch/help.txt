Configuration of GNU patch 2.7.6.25-78ed:

Optional Features:
  --disable-option-checking  ignore unrecognized --enable/--with options
  --disable-FEATURE       do not include FEATURE (same as --enable-FEATURE=no)
  --enable-FEATURE[=ARG]  include FEATURE [ARG=yes]
  --disable-merge         disable support for merging
  --enable-silent-rules   less verbose build output (undo: "make V=1")
  --disable-silent-rules  verbose build output (undo: "make V=0")
  --enable-dependency-tracking
                          do not reject slow dependency extractors
  --disable-dependency-tracking
                          speeds up one-time build
  --disable-largefile     omit support for large files
  --enable-gcc-warnings   turn on lots of GCC warnings (for developers)
  --disable-xattr         do not support extended attributes
  --enable-year2038       support timestamps after 2038

Some influential environment variables:
  CC          C compiler command
  CFLAGS      C compiler flags
  LDFLAGS     linker flags, e.g. -L<lib dir> if you have libraries in a
              nonstandard directory <lib dir>
  LIBS        libraries to pass to the linker, e.g. -l<library>
  CPPFLAGS    (Objective) C/C++ preprocessor flags, e.g. -I<include dir> if
              you have headers in a nonstandard directory <include dir>
  CPP         C preprocessor
  YACC        The "Yet Another C Compiler" implementation to use. Defaults to
              'bison -y'. Values other than 'bison -y' will most likely break
              on most systems.
  YFLAGS      YFLAGS contains the list arguments that will be passed by
              default to Bison. This script will default YFLAGS to the empty
              string to avoid a default value of '-d' given by some make
              applications.

Use these variables to override the choices made by 'configure' or to help
it to find libraries and programs with nonstandard names/locations.
